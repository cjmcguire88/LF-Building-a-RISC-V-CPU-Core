# Building a RISC-V CPU Core

## Thoughts on the Course
Honestly, one of my favorite courses. I am a hobbyist with no formal background in IT. I enjoy playing around with embedded systems and wanted to have a deeper understanding of instruction set architecture. RISC-V, being an open ISA, presents an opportunity to dig deeper than what is currently possible with proprietary ISAs.

## Course Description

This free mini-workshop, offered by by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) of [Redwood EDA, LLC](https://redwoodeda.com), [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [RISC-V International](https://riscv.org) is a crash course in digital logic design and basic CPU microarchitecture. Using the Makerchip online integrated development environment (IDE), you’ll implement everything from logic gates to a simple, but complete, RISC-V CPU core. You’ll be amazed by what you can do using freely-available online tools for open-source development. You’ll walk away with fundamental skills for a career in logic design, and you’ll position yourself on the forefront by learning to use the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog language extension (even if you don’t already know Verilog).

This course is available [in this repository](https://github.com/stevehoover/LF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core-Course/blob/main/course.md) as well as via the [EdX platform](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) (with a certification option).
